            <storng>COFFEE</strong> is really important to us. Providing exceptional responsibly sourced coffee is the standard we live by. Serving it with an unusual kindness is the spirit we live by.

        <p>
            <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> is core to what we do. We are committed to creating an inclusive community atmosphere that is a welcome and inviting place for all. To foster community, we host a variety of meetings, speakers and events along with great live music. We also host Homer's House Church, a small biblical based church meeting in the Homer's conference room every Sunday at 10am, as well as a service for Acts 2 church communities to publicly gather on the first Sunday of each month ("First Sundays") at 10:30am.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>COMPASSION</strong> is the heart of why we exist. We are resolved to helping serve the needy in our community and the world. One thing we can all agree upon is helping those in need. Our hope is to bring people together through compassionate action.
